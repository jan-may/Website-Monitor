# Website-Monitor

Compares saved website hash against newly generated current website hash. If a change is detected, you will get notified via email.
I use the script to up my chances of getting a seat in a mentorship program for university class.

## Usage

- import URLs and corresponding hashes in options variable
- import email credentials via .env file
- use a loop and time.sleep() or a Server to run the file in defined intervals
- get notified via email.
